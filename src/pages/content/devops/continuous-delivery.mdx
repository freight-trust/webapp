# Overview

<strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> capability

Our [Continuous Integration (CI) approach](#) is one of "zero-infrastructure
overhead". To accomplish this goal, we utilize
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build and push a
microservice's associated container images to
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/freightnetwork) for public consumption.

Our [GitOps approach](/infrastructure/devops-gitops) focuses on a
single-repository, environment-per-subdirectory model which can be forked and
cloned to replicate deployments to other clusters and environments. The
reference implementation utilizes [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) as its
templating technology to utilize the `app-deploy.yaml` files, provided by each
individual microservice, as a base and then layer in environment-specific
configuration and credentials as needed.

Our [Continuous Delivery (CD) approach](#continuous-delivery) focuses on a
GitOps-based delivery model, using a GitHub repository as a single source of
truth for the deployment, management, and operations of our running application
components. In this model, we have the flexibility to use multiple open-source
technologies to apply the single source of truth from a given GitHub repository
onto a desired cluster environment.

# Continuous delivery

One of the main tools used in this space is a GitOps-focused continuous delivery
project named [ArgoCD](https://argoproj. github.io/argo-cd/). ArgoCD can monitor
GitHub-based projects and apply changes stored in that repository's YAML files
to a running Kubernetes-based cluster.

Another DevOps tool which provides the opportunity to deployment applications
via the GitOps methodology is [Tekton] (https://tekton.dev/). The Tekton
Pipelines project provides a declarative language for defining and executing
both CI and CD-style pipelines, all defined with common Kubernetes-like
nomenclature. It even has the capability to kick off pipeline runs based off of
GitHub webhooks.
