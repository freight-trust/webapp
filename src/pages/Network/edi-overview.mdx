N101 is assigned a non-built-in XSD data type consisting of the literal "DE\_"
and the data element number. The resulting DE_98 is used to define the available
internal code values and their descriptions.


The following example is for the code lists.

```xml
<xs:simpleType name="DE_98">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:documentation>
```

Code identifying an organizational entity, a physical location, property or an
individual

```xml
</xs:documentation>
</xs:annotation>
<xs:restriction base="ID">
<xs:enumeration value="01">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:documentation>
Loan Applicant
</xs:documentation>
</xs:annotation>
</xs:enumeration>
```

</Row>
</ArticleContainer>

In the example above, DE_98 is assigned a non-built-in XSD data type of ID. Note
that there isn't a minimum or maximum length. The enumerations themselves
specify length. The following illustrates the method of defining X12 data types
in XSD using a built-in XSD type.


```xml
<xs:simpleType name="AN">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:documentation>
A string data element is a sequence of any characters from the basic or extended character sets and contains at least one non-space character. The significant characters shall be left justified. Leading spaces, when they occur, are presumed to be significant characters. In the actual data stream trailing spaces should be suppressed. The representation for this data element type is AN.
</xs:documentation>
</xs:annotation>
<xs:restriction base="xs:string"/>
</xs:simpleType>
<xs:simpleType name="ID">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:documentation>
An identifier data element always contains a unique value from a single, predefined list of values. That list of values is either enumerated within the data element in X12.3 Data Element Dictionary or the source of the list of values is specified in Appendix A in the X12.3 Data Element Dictionary. Trailing spaces should be suppressed. The representation for this data element type is ID.
</xs:documentation>
</xs:annotation>
<xs:restriction base="xs:string"/>
</xs:simpleType>
```

<ArticleContainer
  title="X12 Namespaces"
  subTitle="ASC X12"

<Row>


Many, but not all, of the properties specified in X12.6 map accurately to XML
without change. For example, X12 data element types, such as date, do not
correspond directly to the XSD date data type.

Consequently all XML simple content is declared as a string and an X12
namespace, http://schemas.x12.org/isomorph, is declared.

The elements that come from this namespace are prefixed with x12 and provide
information to be used by applications within an annotation element. For
example, the following is contained within the element for ISA09, the
interchange date:

`<x12:STD_Info name="Interchange Date" Number="I08" DataType="DT" MaximumLength="6"/>`

The attributes in the example above are from the X12 EDI standard. They are
useful for applications that transform EDI to XML and vice versa. The maximum
length attribute is of particular interest because the simple type that is also
within ISA09 has a larger length to accommodate the hyphens and the full four
digits for the year that are in an XML date such as 2018-02-27. The entire
simple type:

```xml
<xs:simpleType>
<xs:restriction base="xs:string">
<xs:minLength value="6"/>
<xs:maxLength value="10"/>
</xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>
```

As illustrated above, this special consideration is used for dates, but also for
times for similar reasons. Additionally it is used for numeric and decimal types
to accommodate implied decimal positions and an optional sign.

In the example above, the N1 segment is the first segment in Loop_1-0700.

The following example is for that segment. Not the entire segment is
illustrated, just enough to point out how a code list for the first data element
is specified.

```xml
<xs:element name="N1_PartyIdentification_1-0700">
<xs:annotation>
<xs:documentation>
Party Identification
</xs:documentation>
</xs:annotation>
<xs:complexType>
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name="N101__EntityIdentifierCode" type="DE_98"/>
<xs:annotation>
<xs:documentation>
Code identifying an organizational entity, a physical location, property or an individual
</xs:documentation>
```
