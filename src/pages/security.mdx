### Expectations In the event of a Data Breach,

All running services will be stopped to prevent further access Impacted users will be notified by email within 24 hours, security@github.com will be notified within 24 hours, along with any other vendors that may be affected.

### Non-Data-Breach Vulnerabilities

Freight Trust routinely monitors for patched vulnerabilities in the software and infrastructure it depends on. Most such vulnerabilities are not at risk of causing a Data Breach. In such cases, they will be patched without user-notification or data-breach response activities. These are published in our RSS Feed.
