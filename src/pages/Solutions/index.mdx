## Introduction

Authenticate the API user as well as to enable OAuth 2.0 authorization for all OAuth protected APIs. 
The Spring Authorization Server is used as an OAuth provider; trading channel applications can  delegates authentication and authorization to this component, which verifies credentials using the Auth Microservice.

## Architecture

### Interaction with Identity Provider (Auth Microservice)


### Interaction with Resource Server API


- When a client wishes to acquire an OAuth token to call a protected API, it calls the OAuth Provider (Authorization microservice) token endpoint with the `username/password` of the user and requests a token with scope `blue`.
- Authorization microservice will call the Customer microservice to get the credentials and perform the validation.
- If the `username/password` are valid, `HTTP 200` is returned, along with a JWT (signed using a HS256 shared secret) in the JSON response under `access_token` which contains the auth ID of the user passed in the `user_name` claim.
- The client uses the JWT in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token to call other Resource Servers that have OAuth protected API (such as the Orders microservice).
- The service implementing the REST API verifies that the JWT is valid and signed using the shared secret, then extracts the `user_name` claim from the JWT to identify the caller.
- The JWT is encoded with scope `blue` and the the expiry time in `exp`; once the token is generated, there is no additional interaction between the Resource Server and the OAuth server.

## APIs

| APIs                       | Function                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `/oauth/authorize`         | Get authorization token           |
| `/oauth/token`             | post authorization token          |

### Project Features

<br/><br/>

- Leverage [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) framework to build a Microservices application.
- Uses [Spring Security OAuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security-oauth).
- Return a signed [JWT](https://jwt.io/) Bearer token back to caller for identity propagation and authorization
- Uses [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) to package application binary and its dependencies.
