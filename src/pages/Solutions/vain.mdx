What we borrow from our own design history is not a mid-century aesthetic in
stylistic terms, but the modernist attitudes and approach used at the time.

## AS2.Network

For a full overview of your EDI processes, AS2.Network lets you follow incoming
and outgoing EDI messages and their delivery statuses in real time. Stay
informed about your message and be notified when it has been successfully
delivered to your recipient or handed over to a third party network such as
Peppol.

### Accelerating Digital First Operations

Value-added networks (VANs) are closed-circuit EDI networks to which companies –
such as GXS or Ariba – can be connected, and over which data is exchanged via
different protocols. To communicate with a company using a VAN, you generally
require a VAN of your own, which can quickly lead to high running costs.

1. Status overview of all sent and received messages
2. Full text search of all sent and received documents
3. User management with unlimited users
4. Flexible message statistics and graphical representation of your
   communication flow
5. Message archive with customisable retention periods
6. Download option for local processing

Central monitoring is also a key benefit, as Freight Trust will deal quickly and
efficiently with any connection issues and technical support needs.
