What we borrow from our own design history is not a mid-century aesthetic in
stylistic terms, but the modernist attitudes and approach used at the time.

## AS2.Network 

For a full overview of your EDI processes, AS2.Network lets you follow incoming and
outgoing EDI messages and their delivery statuses in real time. Stay informed
about your message and be notified when it has been successfully delivered to
your recipient or handed over to a third party network such as Peppol.

### Accelerating Digital First Operations

Value-added networks (VANs) are closed-circuit EDI networks to which companies
– such as GXS or Ariba – can be connected, and over which data is exchanged
via different protocols. To communicate with a company using a VAN, you
generally require a VAN of your own, which can quickly lead to high running
costs.

1. Status overview of all sent and received messages
2. Full text search of all sent and received documents
3. User management with unlimited users
4. Flexible message statistics and graphical representation of your communication flow
5. Message archive with customisable retention periods
6. Download option for local processing

Central monitoring is also a key benefit, as Freight Trust will deal quickly and
efficiently with any connection issues and technical support needs.
