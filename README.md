## Building

### Nodejs Version

`node-version=12.13.0`

### Package Manager

`Yarn` needs `yarn.lock`

If any of the build scripts start with yarn, you must have a `yarn.lock` file.
**Netlify's buildbot will not install Yarn without it**.

### Dependencies and production

If you set the `NODE_ENV` to production, any `devDependencies` in your `package.json` file will not be installed for the build.
